INCIDENT RESPONSE REPORT
========================

Incident ID: INC-2024-BF-001
Date/Time Detected: 2025-07-28 12:58 
Analyst: Juan Marcos Lazaro
Priority: Medium

Incident Type: Brute Force Authentication Attack

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
- Source IP Address: 127.0.0.1
- Target Services: SSH (Port 22), RDP (Port 3389)
- Attack Pattern: Multiple rapid authentication failures followed by successful login
- Targeted Accounts: admin, testuser, weakuser, operator, root
- Time Frame: 2025-07-28 00:42:15 to 2025-07-28 00:48:39
- Total Failed Attempts: 72 (SSH) + 70 (RDP approx.)
- Successful Logins: 
  - SSH: student:SIEMLab2023!
  - RDP: multiple accounts including student, weakuser, operator

Affected Hosts:
- Primary Target: brute-force-lab-base-vm
- Services Impacted: SSH daemon, RDP service
- Compromised Accounts: student (SSH), weakuser and operator (RDP)

Detection Method:
- SIEM Platform: Splunk Enterprise
- Detection Query: 
  index=main sourcetype=linux_secure "Failed password"
  | rex field=_raw "Failed password for (?<username>\S+) from (?<src_ip>\S+)"
  | stats count as failed_attempts by username, src_ip, host
  | where failed_attempts >= 3
  | sort -failed_attempts
- Alert Trigger: >3 failed login attempts within 5-minute window
- Correlation Rule: Failed login attempts followed by successful authentication

Analysis Summary:
The incident represents a simulated brute force attack targeting both SSH and RDP protocols. The attacker attempted multiple username/password combinations using known weak credentials. Over the span of approximately 6 minutes, the system logged dozens of failed SSH and RDP authentication attempts. The SSH attack resulted in a successful login to the student account, while the RDP attack showed numerous successful logins, likely due to insecure configuration in the lab environment.

Evidence Collected:
- /var/log/auth.log entries
- Splunk SIEM search results
- Brute-force attack logs:
  - attack_log.txt (SSH)
  - rdp_attack_log.txt (RDP)
- Python scripts used to simulate the attacks

Recommended Containment Actions:
1. Immediate: Block 127.0.0.1 (in real-world case: attacker IP) at the firewall
2. Short-term: Enforce password reset for all affected users
3. Medium-term: Configure account lockout policies after 3 failed attempts
4. Long-term: Enforce multi-factor authentication for SSH and RDP access

Escalation Path:
- Level 1: Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Level 2: Security Analyst
- Level 3: Incident Response Team
- Management: Security Manager

Next Steps:
1. Execute containment and mitigation actions listed above
2. Continue monitoring SIEM for further brute-force attempts
3. Audit and harden authentication settings and account privileges
4. Conduct training for IT staff on brute-force prevention
5. Refine SIEM rules for faster detection of brute-force patterns
